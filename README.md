+ **Usage** : *source mm; mm*
<p></p>
+ **Brief** : 
	<p>Since an engineer always hangs on a terminal (bash based), it takes lots of time for engineers to browse and select av in the web interface. </p>
	<p>**mm** is just the angel for these engineers! **mm** is only a lite shell function you can put it into your bashrc enviroment, then you can **mm** to browse randomly 24 av title in the console. You can further open a series of pages at the same time with Chrome or renew the mm list only with some text input in command line.</p>
<p></p>
+ **Command line usage** : After the **mm** return a list of mm with #id and titles, you can type some command to **mm** to execute some actions such as open the web page direct to the mm or renew the list or exit.
	- **Open mm pages** : ids of mm page you want to open separated with comma or space. By the way, you can also type 2-10 to open mm pages with id between 2 and 10 (including). <br />
	`e.g. 2,3, 5 9-12 24, 7`<br />
	`above example would open pages with id 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 7 in Chrome`
	- **fetch a new mm list** : *n* makes mm fetch a new list of random mm from 18av.mm-cg.com
	- **exit the loop** : *e*, *q* make you exit the loop and back to the bash
